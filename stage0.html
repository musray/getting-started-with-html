<!-- Hello everyone. I get started to learn web development on udacity.com. -->
<!-- This is what I want to submit as stage0 project. -->
<!--To be honest, I didn't get the point that what I shall submit 
for stage0. But I just decided to copy the code from "learn-2-code.appspot.com" and change it to my own thing." -->
<!--The last but not least: the connection from 
Chian to USA is rather slow at night, Beijing Time. I guss a packet from me maight need 100,000,000 hops to get udacity's server. But I'm the luck one, at least I have the access to google and youtube! -->
